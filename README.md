# Travel-Guide-database-project
Designing a database for a travel guide agency, specifically for the city of Rome. A project for databases class, which took place in 2017. We could describe it a bottom-up approach, because firstly we designed the entity relationship diagram (ERD). Afterwards we designed the relational model (RM) and at the end we implemented our database utilizing the phpmyadmin (MariaDB) and python language.
